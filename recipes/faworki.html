    <h2>Traditional Polish pastry</h2>
        <p>Crispy pastry twists made for Carnival time. They are deep-fried and sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rum</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Combine flour, egg yolks, sour cream, sugar, butter, rum, and salt in a large bowl; mix to form a dough.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Knead dough lightly and roll out on a floured surface. Cut into strips 4 inches long and 3/4 inches wide.
            Cut a slit in the middle of each strip. Twist and pull one end through the slit.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan. Test the temperature by dropping in a pastry twist; the oil is ready when it browns and float to the surface.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Fry pastry twists in batches until golden brown, about 1 minute per side. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar.</p>
