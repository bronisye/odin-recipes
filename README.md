# odin-recipes
First Odin Project

First version:

    Only HTML page with 3 recipes for best Polish dishes, well, in my opinion of course :)

    Skills used:
         - Unordered lists for recipes list and ingredients,
         - <a> tag to navigate from main page to subpages. Also used for return "button" at the bottom of each subpage,
         - <img> tag for dishes images (all images set to 300px height with styles attribute).
